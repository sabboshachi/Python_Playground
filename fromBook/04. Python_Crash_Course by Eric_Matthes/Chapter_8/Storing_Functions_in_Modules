One of the main advantage of function is the way they separate blicks of code form our program. But using
descriptive names for our functions our main program will ne much easier ro follow. We can go a step further
 by storing our function in a separate file called a module and  then impirting that module into oue main program.
 An import statement tells Python to make the code in a module  available in the current running program.
 Storing pur function in a separate file allows us to hide the details of our programs's code and focus on its higher level logic.
