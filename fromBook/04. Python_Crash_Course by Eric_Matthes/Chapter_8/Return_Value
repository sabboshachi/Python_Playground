A function doesn't always have to display ist output directly.
Instead it can process some data and then return a value or a set
of values. The value the function returns is called a return value.
The return statement takes a value from inside a function and sends is back to the line that called the function.
Return values allow us to move much of oue program's grunt work into functions, which can simplify the body of our program.
