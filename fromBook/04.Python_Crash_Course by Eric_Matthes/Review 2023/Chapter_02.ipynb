    "    * Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names; that is, do not use words that Python has reserved for a particular programmatic purpose, such as the word 'print'.\n",
    "    * Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, name is better than n, student_name is better than s_n, and name_length is better than length_of_persons_name.\n",
    "    * Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0."
