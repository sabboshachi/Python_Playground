# keyword Arguments and print()

Most arguments are indetified by their position in the finction call. For example, random.randint(1,10) is different from random.randint(10,1).

**random.randint(1,10)** will return a random integer between 1 and 10, because the first argument is the low end of the range and the second argument is the high end while **random.rendint(10,1)** causes an error.

However, **keyword arguments**However, **keyword arguments** are indentified by the keyword put before them in the function call. Keyword arguments are often used for optional parameters. For example, the print() function has the optional paramenters **end** and **sep** to specify what should be printed at the end of its arguments and between its arguments, respectively. 


```python
print("Hello ")
print("World!")
```

    Hello 
    World!
    


```python
print("Hello " , end= "")
print("World!")
```

    Hello World!
    


```python
print('cats', 'dogs', 'mice')
```

    cats dogs mice
    


```python
print('cats', 'dogs', 'mice', sep= ",")
```

    cats,dogs,mice
    


```python

```
